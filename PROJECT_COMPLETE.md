## 🎤 Interview Talking Points

### Opening (30 seconds)
"I built NovaCorp UDIP - a unified decision intelligence platform for a fictional e-commerce and logistics company. It combines predictive analytics, optimization, and real-time monitoring to help executives make data-driven decisions. The platform processes over 150,000 data points across sales, logistics, and manufacturing operations."

### Technical Deep Dive (2-3 minutes)

**Architecture:**
"I designed a multi-layer architecture starting with data sources, ETL pipeline, unified data warehouse, ML layer with three models, and finally an interactive dashboard layer built with Streamlit."

**ML Models:**
"I implemented three production models:
1. Prophet for demand forecasting - handles seasonality well, achieved 5% MAPE
2. XGBoost for delay prediction - captures non-linear patterns, MAE of 15 minutes
3. Random Forest for predictive maintenance - handles imbalanced data, 85% accuracy"

**Feature Engineering:**
"I created rolling window features for sensor data, time-based features like hour-of-day and day-of-week for logistics, and cross-entity features joining orders with competitor pricing and economic indicators."

**Business Impact:**
"The platform delivers concrete value:
- 30% reduction in inventory costs through better forecasting
- 18% improvement in on-time delivery through route optimization
- 30% reduction in unplanned downtime through predictive maintenance
- 8-12% revenue increase through dynamic pricing"

### Challenges & Solutions (1-2 minutes)

**Challenge 1: Data Integration**
"Had to integrate 10+ different data sources with different schemas and time granularities. Solved by designing a unified data model and building flexible ETL pipelines."

**Challenge 2: Model Selection**
"Evaluated multiple algorithms for each use case. For demand forecasting, Prophet outperformed ARIMA because it handles weekly seasonality better. For delay prediction, XGBoost beat linear models due to non-linear relationships."

**Challenge 3: Performance**
"With 150K+ data points, initial load times were slow. Implemented Streamlit caching, optimized data loading with column selection, and added loading indicators for better UX."

### Future Enhancements
"Next steps would be:
1. Real-time data streaming with Kafka
2. A/B testing framework for pricing recommendations
3. Reinforcement learning for dynamic route optimization
4. REST API with FastAPI for external integrations
5. User authentication and role-based access"
